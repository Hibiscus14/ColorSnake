<h1 id="colorsnake-v1.0">ColorSnake v2.0!</h1>
<p>ColorSnake is an image sorting programm that is writen
fully on C++, using Qt creator and openCV, by a single developer.<br> <br>This program is
here to make sorting your images by color an easy task.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>This program has a bunch of features to help you sort your images the right way.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mask</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This feature creates a mask to eliminate unwanted pixels from affecting the result of the sorting algorithm. It works by setting desired Saturation and Value settings, and not taking in count pixels that doesn’t meet the requirements you’ve set.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black&amp;White split</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This feature moves all Black and White images to the end of sorting line, so it won’t interrupt the beautiful sorted colors with mostly white or mostly black images. It works by setting desired Saturation and Value settings and if images don’t meet the required settings above - they are moved to the end of the sorting list, creating a pleasant black to white gradient</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compression</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This feature compresses images before sorting, so the sorting will take less time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom zone</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This feature allows you to select a custom zone that you want to look for in all the images. Its helpful for sorting portraits, collection photos, or anything that has the main thing you want to sort by in ± the same place. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multithreading</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Perform parallel processing in 4 threads during image operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dark and Light theme for everyone to use :D nothing fancy, but its here!)</p>

<h2 id="features">Warnings</h2>

 

If while sorting you will choose a different window - the program interface will freeze, but it will continue to work in background. The same effect might take place if you are trying to sort a big ammount of immages.

All the files and folders should be in English, otherwise program won't work.
